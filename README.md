# SSTi-RCE-POC
SSTi simple command execution for a HTB challenge...

This POC was made for a HackTheBox challenge with very simple SSTi vulnerability. But with a little modification, can be used with any SSTi vulnerable webapp. This is basically just a wrapper around the SSTi RCE exploit. With emulation of an interactive shell!

Sadly most of special chars aren't allowed :(
